<!-- 
Welcome to the **Loop Logic Arena** — a brain workout made with love in pure Python! 🧠💥  
This project is filled with quirky, sneaky, and mind-bending loop-based challenges that range from **easy to insane** difficulty levels.

A fun and mind-bending set of `for` loop experiments written in python. 

These cover:
- Nested loop behaviors
- Modifying loop variables inside the body
- Logical OR / AND combinations
- Counter tracking in nested scopes

Each block is designed to test, surprise, or trick the reader.
Great for debugging practice or teaching flow control! 


It's a great way to improve:
- Loop logic tracing
- Mental dry-running skills
- Edge case catching
